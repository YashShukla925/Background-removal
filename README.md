## Background Removal Using IS-Net

This project provides a background removal tool using the IS-Net model, where users can upload an image and get the processed result with the background removed.

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that uses the IS-Net model to perform background removal on uploaded images. The model is trained to remove the background and retain only the foreground object(s), which is useful for tasks like image segmentation and object isolation.

## Features

- Upload an image.
- Remove the background from the uploaded image.
- Display the processed result.
- Built with Streamlit for the user interface and IS-Net model for background removal.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
